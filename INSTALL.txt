Installation
============

$ scons install 

You can pass several options to scons, e.g.

INSTALL_AS_SYML=(1|0)
  installs header and library files as symbolic links (instead of copying 
  them)

OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS='<flags>'
  Extra flags passed to the compiler, e.g. '-O3'

RELEASE=(1|0)
  Builds with or without debug code

For additional flags resp. their (cached) values, type

$ scons -h

After successfully building the repository, you can execute the tests with

$ install/bin/lanelet_tests

A small demo program resides in libLanelet/demo.cpp, which is included in 
the build as well and executable with

$ install/bin/demo libLanelet/sample.osm

'sample.osm' is a tiny example map snippet.
